this is a (not so) short list of shit we need to know for this project.

* The assembly language is a specific variant for this course.

There are 3 stages of creating and opening a code in a computer:
1. Compiling
2. Linking
3. Loading
this is only suppose to do the first part.

this is an "imaginary" computer, it includes:
1. CPU
2. Registers
3. RAM
* Some of the ram will be used for stack.

Registers: 
1. The computer has 8 general registers:
        r0, r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, r6, r7
    The size of each register is 24 bits.
        The least important one is bit 0 -> most important is bit 23.
* the register name will always be written with a lowercase 'r'.

2. There is another register called PSW (Program Status Word):
    The PSW includes flags that show the status of the cpu at any given moment.

RAM:
1.  The size of the ram is 2^21 cells.
        The cell addresses are 0 to 2^21-1.

        The size of each cell is 24 bits (reminds you of something?)
        The bits inside each cell are numbered in the same way as the registers.
        
    * A cell in the memory is also called "word".

This computer only works with FULL positive or negative numbers.
The arithmetics is done in the 2's complement method. (I have no clue what is the meaning of that)
The computer has support for ascii characters.
